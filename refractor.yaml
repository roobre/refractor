# Number of workers to start. This controls the amount of parallel chunk downloads.
# This should be set reasonably higher than the number of pacman parallel downloads.
#workers: 8

# Number of top workers. Mirrors that are ranked below this number in throughput will be rotated out of the pool
# and replaced with new random mirrors.

# Throughput considered "good" regardless of worker rank. Mirrors that are currently transmitting data at a
# rate higher than this are never rotated out, regardless of their rank.
# It should be set to a value _smaller_ than `(your ISP bandwidth in MiB/s)/(workers)`.
